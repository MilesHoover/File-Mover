This is a file identifier and mover tool used to sort cluttered files with many different extensions. Currently, I have it programmed to create a database of all files in a folder, sort out any ".txt" files in your selected folder, and then move them into the folder of your choice. 

To run this program:
1. download my code
2. open a CLI and chdr to the "file-mover" folder
3. run "py Combined_Drills.py"
4. select the "from_Folder" I have provided or the folder of your choice
5. select the "to_Folder" I have provided or the folder of your choice

et voila! your intrusive .txt files have been sorted out of the messy folder!
